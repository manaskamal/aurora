Goals for Aurora Kernel:
-------------------------

SMP/NUMA
SSE/AVX/AVX-512
Advanced lockings for atomic operations
Better data structures
Better VFS Subsystem / FAT32 Filesystem
Better IPC (Pipes/Shared Memory/Message queues/Sockets)
Better and smooth PTY Subsystem
Good Driver Management
Good Process / Thread management
Dynamic linker
Good Memory Management with avoid of fragmentations
Page swapping
Graphics stack (should be named as project)
Better Audio Mixer (should be named as project)
Network Stack
Unix styled system calls
File Mappings
Security
ACPI Shutdown/Reboot 


(Smooth performance, fastness, robus, stable, scalability and better
 user experience with better processed audio and video are the primary goal
 of this project, it should also provide some extra unique features for the users,
 and users should experience some unexpericed features, and user should feel the 
 kernel performance along with user space)

User Can Handle three options:
. One click build
. Portability of user applications without complication
. Every user should feel easy and comfortable with the software

Drivers:
----------
Bluetooth
Wifi
E1000

Intel UHD/HD Graphics


User Space Ports:
-----------------
