# Build Aurora 

To build aurora for x86_64 architecture, simply open the _'kernel.sln_' and build the project. Note that before building the kernel, change the output location in the _'Linker Section'_ of the project properties. Also build the _'auldr'_ by simply opening the _'auldr.sln'_ inside the _'ldr/auldr'_ directory, also change the output location. Enjoy!
